 *	Instructions: 	                             ****** IMPORTANT ******
 * 					1. Pair the mimolite to SmartThings before installing the physical device into the chime casing.
 * 					2. Edit it's device type file to use this file. (I am assuming you know how.)
 * 					3. With device powered up and paired to SmartThings, go into the device detail screen and tap
 * 					   "configure". This sets the device to send a "power loss" signal.
 * 					4. Now you can pysically install the device into the chime.
 * 
 * 					If you have already paired the mimolite to smartthings and installed it into the chime casing,
 * 					but you have not run configure do the following:
 * 					1. Open the device detail screen on your mobile device.
 * 					2. Go to the doorbell button location (usually at front door).
 * 					3. Press and hold down the button while at the same time tap the "configure" tile in SmartThings.
 * 					4. Wait 5 seconds and release the doorbell button.
 *
 *					Now press and release your doorbell button as you normally would. You should see the device
 *					icon display a darker blue and the text "DING-DONG". This will display this way for 20 seconds.
 *
 *					This device is best used with an app that can subscribe to the "button.pushed" event from
 *					the device.
